## Description
This repository contains multiple Python projects organized within the `Python Projects` folder. Below is an overview of each project:

### Projects Overview
1. **[First Project: Money Tracker](./#first-project)**
    - Description: Tracks expenses, income, and balance using Tkinter-Designer library.
    - Folder: `First Project/Money_Dashboard/Money-Tracker/build`
    - Main File: `gui.py`

2. **[Second Project: Login System](./#second-project)**

   The second project is a login form application designed to authenticate users. It allows users to input their username and password, which are then validated against existing credentials stored in a JSON file.    If the entered credentials match an existing user, the user is successfully logged in. If not, the entered username and password are saved to the JSON file for future reference.
    - Ability to input and store username and password.
    - Login Authentication: Validates user input against stored credentials.
    - JSON File Handling: Stores and retrieves usernames and passwords from a JSON file.
    - "Suggest password" button for automatic password generation.
   This project serves as a fundamental demonstration of user authentication and data management techniques in Python, showcasing practical implementation of login systems.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the desired project folder.
- Run the main Python file to launch the application.
