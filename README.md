## Description
This repository contains multiple Python projects organized within the `Python Projects` folder. Below is an overview of each project:

### Projects Overview
1. **[First Project: Money Tracker](./#first-project)**
    - Description: Tracks expenses, income, and balance using Tkinter-Designer library.
    - Folder: `First Project/Money_Dashboard/Money-Tracker/build`
    - Main File: `gui.py`

2. **[Second Project: Login System](./#second-project)**

    The second project is a login form application designed to authenticate users. It allows users to input their username and password, which are then validated against existing credentials stored in a JSON file.    If the entered credentials match an existing user, the user is successfully logged in. If not, the entered username and password are saved to the JSON file for future reference.
    - Ability to input and store username and password.
    - Login Authentication: Validates user input against stored credentials.
    - JSON File Handling: Stores and retrieves usernames and passwords from a JSON file.
    - "Suggest password" button for automatic password generation.

    This project serves as a fundamental demonstration of user authentication and data management techniques in Python, showcasing practical implementation of login systems.

3. **[Third Project: YouTube video Downloader](./#third-project)**

    The third project is a simple yet powerful YouTube downloader application built using Python, Pytube and CustomTkinter GUI library.With this application, users can effortlessly download their favorite YouTube videos directly to their local machine.

    - YouTube Video Download: Allows users to input the URL of the YouTube video they want to download.
    - Folder Selection: Allows users to choose the destination folder where the downloaded video will be saved.
    - Download Progress Bar: Displays a progress bar indicating the download status of the video.
    - Notification Message: Informs users about the download status, whether it was successful or encountered errors.
    - Automatic Progress Tracking: Tracks the download progress in real-time and updates the progress bar accordingly.

    This project demonstrates the seamless integration of Python's PyTube library for handling YouTube downloads and Tkinter for building a user-friendly graphical interface. It provides users with a convenient way to download videos from YouTube with ease.
