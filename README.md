## Description
This repository contains multiple Python projects organized within the `Python Projects` folder. Below is an overview of each project:

### Projects Overview
1. **[First Project: Money Tracker](./#first-project)**
    - Description: Tracks expenses, income, and balance using Tkinter-Designer library.
    - Folder: `First Project/Money_Dashboard/Money-Tracker/build`
    - Main File: `gui.py`

2. **[Second Project: Login System](./#second-project)**
      The second project is a login form application designed to manage user authentication. The application allows users to input their username and password, which are then stored in a JSON file upon clicking         the login button. Additionally, the login form includes a "suggest password" button, which automatically generates a random password and inserts it directly into the password field.
    - User-friendly login interface.
    - Ability to input and store username and password.
    - Storage of user credentials in a JSON file.
    - "Suggest password" button for automatic password generation.
      This project demonstrates proficiency in handling user input, data storage, and basic security measures for user authentication within Python applications.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the desired project folder.
- Run the main Python file to launch the application.
